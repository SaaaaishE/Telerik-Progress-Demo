# Aleksandar's demo app for Telerik Progress

This is a simple demo Blazor project that has one page displaying products from a list.

All of the app's styling is made on Bootstrap with almost no additional css.

The products are placed in a grid with 3 columns for each row when viewed on a standard computer monitor (16:9).

Bootstrap gives the opportunity for responsiveness so the products could be viewed in a good style on any display resolution.

WebAssembly hosting model is chosen so the app could run on the client's browser thus saving the server's resources.
